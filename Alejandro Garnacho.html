            <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
            <p>BIOGRAPHY
                Exciting winger, who signed from Atletico Madrid in 2020.
                
                A lively front-runner, who had an enviable goals record in his homeland, he has appeared mostly on the left-hand side of attack since breaking into the Under-18s team.
                
                He made his Academy debut as a substitute in the mini-Manchester derby in October 2020, and scored his first goal against Everton.
                
                Garnacho has enjoyed prolific goalscoring form in the 2021/22 season, with notable performances in the Under-18s' FA Youth Cup run. The Madrid-born winger scored twice in the quarter-final against Leicester City at Old Trafford, having also netted in games against Everton and Scunthorpe United at the Theatre of Dreams. He also played a key role in helping the Under-19s to the UEFA Youth League last-16.
                
                Alejandro has represented Spain at youth levels, but is also eligible to play for Argentina, the country of his mother's birth. In March 2022, he received a call-up to Argentina's preliminary squad for their FIFA 2022 World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Ecuador.
                
                On 28 April 2022, Garnacho made his senior debut for the Reds when he came on as an injury-time substitute, replacing Anthony Elanga, in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea in Premier League.
                
                The following season, on 8 September 2022, the forward made his European bow for United when he joined the field as a second-half substitute during the Reds' Europa League opener against Real Sociedad at Old Trafford.</p>
